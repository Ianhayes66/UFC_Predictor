# Contributing Guide

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch using conventional commits.
2. Run `make setup` to install dependencies and pre-commit hooks.
3. Add tests for any new functionality; maintain 85%+ coverage.
4. Run `make check` before pushing (formats, lints, type-checks, tests).
5. Submit a PR with a summary, test evidence, and any configuration changes.

Follow PEP 484 typing, Google-style docstrings, and avoid TODO comments in committed code.
